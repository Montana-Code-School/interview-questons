#### event bubbling
- bubbling is best described by example
```HTML
  <form onclick="alert('form')">FORM
    <div onclick="alert('div')">DIV
      <p onclick="alert('p')">P</p>
    </div>
  </form>
```

- if we were to click the `<p>` element here, we would also trigger
the events specified on its parent elements in order. We would get
an alert 'p', then 'div', then, 'form'. This is known as bubbling.

- often undesirable, bubbling can be contained by using the
.stopPropagation() and .stopImmediatePropagation() methods.
