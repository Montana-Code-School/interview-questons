## General
* What is API and how is it used?
 - an API is an Application Programming Interface that essentially allows access to outside databases and the ability to manipulate and utilize the data within.


* Asynchronous code
 - code in which all processes are able to work independently of each other without waiting for other process to finish before more start.

* Immutability
 - means literally that nothing can be mutated. This is the difference between const (which is immutable) and let or var (which are mutable). In javascript only primitive types can really be immutable (string, number, bool). For objects, they are mutable by default b/c the assignment operator is essentially just a memory pointer, so any change will effect all.
