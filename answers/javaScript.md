## JavaScript
* `null` vs `undefined` - Null means there is 'no value.' Undefined represents a variable that has not been declared or not given a value.
	* What does `type of null` output? It returns 'object.'
* `==` vs `===`
		- == compares values but not data types. eg. `3 == "3"` would be true. ie... it converts the values.
		-	=== compares values including data types. `3 === "3"` would be false ie.... it doesn't convert values.
